# jobsjoggt
A game by a few high school students written in Rust.
For now, there is not much to see, just a "Hello, World!" - we're still learning. Plus, exams.

## Development
For now, we are working on implementing baseline functionality, such as windowing, rendering, assets, input handling.

Don't expect too good code, as this project is meant as a playground for us, however we do try our best!
